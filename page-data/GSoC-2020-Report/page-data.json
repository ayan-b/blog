Thank you for the constant guidance and valuable feedback whenever I was stuck. I express my heartfelt gratitude to Lia, Paula, the whole The Virual Brain and INCF team and, Google for making the last four months such a rewarding experience!</p>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>While running simulation on cortical surfaces we need to calculate geodesic distance as opposed to euclidean distance due to the shape of the cortical surface. The virtual brain uses geodesic<em>library for this calculation. The library implements the original paper in C++. The original source code can be found in Google Code Archive: <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/geodesic\">https://code.google.com/archive/p/geodesic</a>. tvb</em>geodesic repository implements a cython wrapper on top of the C++ code which then is released to Pypi (tvb-gdist) and conda-forge (Tvb Gdist).</p>\n<p>However, the code is now outdated and users have reported various issues. In this project, we aim to update the code and fix those issues.</p>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<p>The package exposes 3 APIs which can be used for various purposes: <code class=\"language-text\">compute_gdist</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">local_gdist_matrix</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">distance_matrix_of_selected_points</code>. Examples and detailed instructions can be found in the project <a href=\"https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-gdist\">readme</a> page.</p>\n<h2>Project Status</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Completed Work</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing an issue where numpy requirement is causing installation problems using <code class=\"language-text\">pyproject.toml</code></li>\n<li>Lint fixes, the codebase is now PEP8 compliant</li>\n<li>Adding coverge report functionality</li>\n<li>Updating the travis CI configuration</li>\n<li>Fixing memory leak issue for <code class=\"language-text\">compute_gdist</code></li>\n<li>Adding a new API for pairwise distance computation</li>\n<li>Adding documentation in the README file</li>\n<li>Running different versions of Python on Windows</li>\n<li>Enabing users to specify if a the faces vertices’ are 1-indexed</li>\n<li>Adding googletest to test and measure coverage of the c++ library</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incomplete Work</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using ctypes instead of cython</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-gdist\">Link</a> to the project in GitHub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/tvb-gdist\">Link</a> to the project in PyPI</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-gdist/commits?author=ayan-b\">Link</a> to the list of commits</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-gdist/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aayan-b+\">Link</a> to the pull requests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ayan-b.github.io/blog/gsoc-2020-weekly-reports/\">Link</a> to the weekly reports</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://req.thevirtualbrain.org/projects/TVB/issues/TVB-2719\">Link</a> to Jira story</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"GSoC 2020 Report","date":"August 26, 2020","description":"GSoC 2020 Report for my work at INCF"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/GSoC-2020-Report/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bash-function-for-git-squash/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bash Shortcut for Git Squash"}},"next":null}}}
