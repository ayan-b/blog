For this (genomics visualization and analysis),\nthere are many datasets which are provided by data hubs available with Xenabrowser itself which users can use. The data\nhubs are: <em>UCSC Public Hub</em>, <em>TCGA Hub</em>, <em>Pan-Cancer Atlas Hub</em>, <em>ICGC Hub</em>, <em>UCSC Toil RNAseq Recompute</em>, <em>Treehouse Hub</em>\nand <em>GDC Hub</em>. Our discussion of interest lies in the GDC Hub.</p>\n<p>GDC (Genomic Data Commons) Hub fetches data from the GDC repository:\n<a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository\">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository</a> via the GDC API. However, the data on\nthe Xena is not updated. Current Xena data was updated on <em>release 10</em>, roughly 1.5 yrs ago. This project mainly revolves\naround updating data on xena with the current release (<em>release 15</em>). This will also simplify the process of adding data\nto Xena removing the XML files as a source.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Specific details, key aspects and anticipated challenges</h3>\n<p>The process involves two high-level goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Updating GDC data wrangling pipeline</span></em>: The pipeline code (<em>i.e.</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/yunhailuo/xena-GDC-ETL\">https://github.com/yunhailuo/xena-GDC-ETL</a> currently fetches the data from GDC repository via GDC API) is outdated. This part of the goals aims to update with the latest release.</li>\n<li><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Updating GDC data on Xena</span></em>: As the data wrangling pipeline will be updated, this part of the goals will aim to update the GDC data on xena.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Tell us what research into this project you have done</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I have analyzed the gdc module of the <code class=\"language-text\">xena-GDC-ETL</code> package and added tests for the same. The module currently has 82% test coverage. In my analysis, I have found that the code and APIs used in the module are updated with the upstream.</li>\n<li>During my contributions to the repo, I got sound knowledge on the modules and what task each of them performs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Break the project down into smaller tasks</h3>\n<h4>Phase 1 (Week 1-4):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the overall project in this phase, <em>i.e.</em> adding tests, fixing lint issues, improving CLI and setting up\ndoctests for existing ones and release the project to pypi.</li>\n<li>Fix broken APIs and code for fetching new data from API.</li>\n<li>Start adding code for the new data provided by GDC API. The package should be able to fetch and upload\nFM Simple Somatic Mutation data by the end of this period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Phase 2 (Week 5-7):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add and upload GISTIC - Copy Number Score, DNAcopy data and Star - Counts data into xena and document the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Phase 3 (Week 8-11):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish uploading the data into xena, add docs and doctests.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>This week-by-week timeline provides a rough guideline of how the project will be done.</p>\n<table>\n  <tr><td>Phase</td><td>Date</td><td>Tasks</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>Community Bonding</td><td>May 7 - May 26</td><td>\n   <ul>\n      <li>Familiarising myself with the mentors and the codebase.

Some <strong>shell</strong> scripting may be required for automating stuff (tests, linting, etc.).\nSome other technology requirements are <strong>Git</strong> (for version control), <strong>Jinja2</strong>(for templating), <strong>CI</strong>(Continuous Integration) and writing docs using <strong>Sphinx</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Any prior experience with open source development?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I have been a core developer at the organization <strong>moremoban</strong> for the last 4 months. I am mainly involved with the\nproject <strong>moban</strong>, <em>a jinja2 CLI command for static text generation</em>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/moremoban/moban/commits?author=ayan-b\">contributions</a>) and\n<strong>pypi-mobans</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/moremoban/pypi-moban/commits?author=ayan-b\">contributions</a>).\nThese 2 projects are used as repository management tools, and they are written in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jinja2</strong>.\nI developed 2 plugins for the project: <a href=\"https://github.com/moremoban/moban-velocity\">moban-velocity</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/moremoban/moban-haml\">moban-haml</a> and released them into <a href=\"https://pypi.org/user/ayanb/\">PyPi</a>.</li>\n<li>I have also contributed to the <code class=\"language-text\">xena-GDC-ETL</code> repository.
