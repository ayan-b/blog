Recently, I did fundamental analysis of TCS as a part of assignment in Investment Management
and Stock Market course. Here it is: [link](./TCS-Fundamental-Analysis.pdf). It would be
interesting to see how I did in the coming years. 😉

I also did [technical analysis](./TCS-Technical-Analysis.pdf). Hopefully, this will be helpful for future
reference!

The sources I used: Moneycontrol, TCS annual and quarterly reports and WikiPedia.
