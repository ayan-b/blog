Recently, I did fundamental analysis of TCS as a part of assignment in Investment Management
and Stock Market course. Here it is: [link](./TCS-Fundamental-Analysis.pdf). It would be
interesting to see how I did in the coming years. ðŸ˜‰

The sources I used: Moneycontrol, TCS annual and quarterly reports and WikiPedia.
